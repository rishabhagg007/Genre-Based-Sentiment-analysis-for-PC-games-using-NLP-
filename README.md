# Genre-Based-Sentiment-analysis-for-PC-games-using-NLP-

This project aims to conduct in depth analysis on the user reviews of popular personal computer video games segmented by genres. A list of the most popular PC games with different genres and published between 2020 and 2021 is obtained from the RAWG database. All of the text and ratings from critic and user reviews on each of these games are then web-scrapped from MetaCritic.com and stored in mongoDB. 
We were able to quickly identify the top keywords mentioned by users within a gaming genre using NLP. We constructed the frequency distribution of keywords based on sentiment and outputted our findings in the form of word clouds. We also implemented machine learning classifiers such as random forest and weighted logistic regression in attempts to predict user ratings based on the sentiment analysis for player reviews. Our model was able to achieve 80% accuracy in successfully classifying the sentiments as positive, negative or neutral.
Through this exercise we came to the conclusion that there is tremendous potential in applying machine learning techniques to the review texts of video games. Game developers will be able to obtain genre-specific insights on their customers. After further refinement, our analyses and models can be applied to a broader range of games.
